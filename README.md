This is an application to find your book

We used javascript, Jquery, apis and a lot of hours in zoom to make this work after we found out our first idea wasnt going to work.

When you search you can search by either the title or the author or for a more specific search both.

you will be presented with the most relevant books to the right along with the new york times best sellers at the top of the page.

you can also use recent searches if you have searched before. Also there is a reset button both are working.

We hope you enjoy our litte application as we did work tirelessly to make sense of it and make it presentable.
